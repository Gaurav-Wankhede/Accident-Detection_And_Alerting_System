# üöë ACCIDENT DETECTION WITH A REPORTING SYSTEM üöë

## ABSTRACT
The rapidly growing global population, combined with improving economic conditions, is leading to a significant increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. This surge in vehicular traffic has introduced numerous challenges for various authorities, among which road accidents are of utmost priority. Timely and accurate detection of accident sites can save countless lives by enabling emergency services to respond swiftly and efficiently. 

Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python programming, this project aims to accurately locate accident scenes and promptly report them to emergency services. By reducing the response time, the system aims to significantly lower the fatality rate associated with road accidents. Implementation of this system in real life will greatly benefit concerned authorities and help in saving precious human lives.

## Requirements üìã
1. Download and install the Anaconda Distribution.
2. Create an account on Twilio, a service providing programmable communication tools (a 7-day free trial is available).

## Procedure üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Download and Extract Files:**
   - Download the project files and extract them to the `C:\Users\Admin` path.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.
   - Navigate to the project folder within Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Set Up Twilio Account:**
   - Create an account on Twilio.
   - Obtain a virtual phone number, account SID, and auth token from your Twilio account.

4. **Configure the Program:**
   - Open the `Accident Detection-Video.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Enter your Twilio account details (virtual phone number, account SID, and auth token).
   - Input the phone number to which you want to send the SMS alert.

5. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute the code in the notebook to activate the accident detection and reporting system.
